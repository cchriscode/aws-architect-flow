# Complete Mastery of Incident Management — You Can't Prevent Failures, But You Can Design Your Response

> Service failures are a matter of **"when they happen" rather than "if they happen."** Now that you've learned about Error Budget from [SRE Principles](./01-principles) and mastered detecting warning signs from [Alerting](../08-observability/11-alerting), it's time to learn how to systematically manage the **entire incident lifecycle from the moment an alert fires until the end** — this is incident management.

## 🎯 Why Do You Need to Know About Incident Management?

### Daily analogy: Emergency Room System

Think of a hospital emergency room.

- A patient is brought in (incident detection)
- A triage nurse **classifies severity** — cardiac arrest? Fracture? Cold? (severity classification)
- A critical patient is **immediately assigned a dedicated medical team** (incident commander)
- If the assigned doctor is unavailable, **another doctor is called** (escalation)
- While treating, **information is communicated to the patient's family** (communication)
- After treatment, **medical records are written** (post-mortem)
- If a similar patient comes again, **the team can respond faster** (improvement)

What happens if the ER operates without a system?

```
What happens in teams without incident management:

  "Service went down at 3 AM but nobody knew"              → No detection system
  "I got the alert but didn't know who should respond"    → No on-call system
  "10 people were looking at the same problem simultaneously" → No incident commander
  "Customer calls flooded in during the outage"            → No communication plan
  "The same failure happened again 3 months later"         → No post-mortem
  "The incident report says 'Kim dev made a mistake'"      → No blameless culture
```

### Chaotic team vs Incident Management team

```

### Why Incident Management Matters from a Business Perspective

```
📊 Cost of Downtime (Industry Average):

  1 hour of SEV1 failure = $100,000 ~ $1,000,000+ loss
  Reducing MTTR by 10 minutes = Saves hundreds of millions annually
  Loss of customer trust → 25% increase in churn rate

📈 Benefits of Implementing Incident Management:
  MTTD (Detection Time)     : 30 min → 2 min     (93% improvement)
  MTTR (Recovery Time)      : 3 hours → 20 min   (89% improvement)
  Recurrence Rate           : 40% → 8%           (80% improvement)
  On-call Burnout           : High → Manageable  (Better retention)
```

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What is an Incident?

**An Incident** is an event that disrupts or threatens normal service operation. It's different from simple bugs or improvements.

```
🔥 Incident
   - A situation that is currently or will soon impact the service
   - Requires immediate response
   - Examples: API response time 10 seconds, payment failure rate spike, database down

🐛 Bug
   - Service works but behaves differently than expected
   - Handled as a regular ticket
   - Examples: UI broken on specific browser, incorrect error message

💡 Improvement
   - Service works but could be better
   - Managed in backlog
   - Examples: Optimize API response speed, improve log format
```

### Five Pillars of Incident Management

| Pillar | Description | Analogy |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Detection** | Quickly discovering the problem | Fire detector |
| **Response** | Right person taking immediate action | Fire trucks dispatched |

## 🔍 Deep Dive

### 1. Incident Lifecycle

Every incident goes through 5 stages. Skipping any stage causes problems.

    style M fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style Re fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style L fill:#9b59b6,color:#fff
```

#### Stage 1: Detect (Detection)

The stage of becoming aware of the problem. There are several ways to detect it.

```
Detection source priority:

  Priority 1: Automatic monitoring alerts     ← Most ideal (Proactive)
    - Prometheus Alert Rules
    - SLO-based Error Budget Burn Rate alerts
    - APM anomaly detection

  Priority 2: Internal reporting               ← Acceptable
    - Developer discovers after deployment
    - QA team finds during testing
    - Internal tool monitoring

  Priority 3: Customer reporting               ← Needs improvement
    - Support team notification
    - Social media mentions
    - Direct inquiry
```

Improving detection quality is covered in detail in [Alerting](../08-observability/11-alerting). The key is using **symptom-based alerting** and **SLO-based alerts**.

#### Stage 2: Respond (Response)

The stage where appropriate personnel are deployed after detection.

```yaml
# Response stage checklist
respond_checklist:
  - "Has the on-call engineer acknowledged the alert?"
  - "Has an incident channel (Slack/Teams) been created?"
  - "Has incident severity been determined?"
  - "Has an Incident Commander been assigned?"
  - "Have necessary roles (TL, Communications Lead) been assigned?"
  - "Has the status page been updated?"
```

#### Stage 3: Mitigate (Mitigation)

The **first aid** stage of minimizing user impact. The goal is **stopping the bleeding**, not fixing the root cause.

```
Mitigation strategies:

  🔄 Rollback
     - Fastest response when recent deployment is the cause
     - "If problems occur within 30 min of deployment → rollback immediately"

  📈 Scale Out
     - When traffic spike is the cause
     - Auto-scaling or manually adding instances

  🚫 Feature Flag Off
     - When a specific feature is the cause
     - Toggle off that feature only

  🔀 Traffic Shift
     - When a specific region/AZ has issues
     - Reroute traffic via DNS or load balancer

  🗄️ Cache Invalidation
     - When bad cached data is the cause
     - Flush cache and regenerate

  ⏸️ Queue Pause
     - When async processing is overloaded
     - Stop queue consumption for cleanup
```

#### Stage 4: Resolve (Resolution)

The stage of finding and fixing the root cause.

```
Difference between Mitigation and Resolution:

  Mitigate: "We rolled back to restore service"
  Resolve:  "We fixed the memory leak code and deployed"

  Mitigate: "We isolated the problematic server"
  Resolve:  "We replaced the disk and recovered data"

  ⚠️ If you only mitigate without resolving → same failure repeats!
```

#### Stage 5: Learn (Learning)

The stage of preventing recurrence through post-mortems. **The most important yet most often skipped stage**.

```
Core activities in the Learning stage:

  📝 Write post-mortem (within 72 hours)
  👥 Post-mortem review meeting (within 1 week)
  📋 Register and track action items
  📊 Update incident metrics
  📚 Update Runbooks
  🔔 Improve alerting rules
```

### 2. Severity Classification

You can't respond to all incidents the same way. **Response level must vary by severity.**

#### SEV Level Definitions

```
┌─────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level  │  Definition and Criteria                                         │

│         │  • Non-core feature unavailable                                 │
│         │  • Workaround exists                                            │
│         │  • Examples: Notification delay, report slow, specific browser   │
│         │  • Response: During business hours, same day resolution          │
├─────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SEV4   │  🟢 Low — Minor issue                                            │

│         │  • Cosmetic issue or minor inconvenience                        │
│         │  • Examples: Typo, minor UI break, log warning message           │
│         │  • Response: Backlog, handle in next sprint                      │
└─────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

```

#### Response Guidelines by SEV Level

```yaml
# incident-severity-policy.yaml
severity_levels:
  SEV1:
    response_time: "Within 5 minutes"
    resolution_target: "Within 1 hour"
    on_call: "Immediate page (24/7)"

### 3. Incident Roles

In large incidents, one person can't do everything. **Role separation is key to effective response.**

#### Incident Commander (IC) — Incident Commander

The **overall owner** of the incident. Not the person fixing the code, but the person **coordinating the entire situation**.

```
IC's Responsibilities (like a hospital chief physician):

  ✅ IC Does:
    • Determine and declare incident severity
    • Assign roles (TL, Communications Lead, etc.)
    • Maintain overall situational awareness and make decisions
    • Decide on escalation
    • Manage timeline ("Please share status in 10 minutes")
    • Decide on additional resource allocation

  ❌ IC Doesn't:
    • Directly modify code or debug
    • Perform detailed technical analysis
    • Respond to customers
    • Write post-mortems (separate responsibility)

  💡 Analogy: A fire department commander doesn't fight the fire directly.
           They oversee the entire situation and deploy personnel and equipment.
```

#### Overall Role Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Incident Commander (IC)                     │
│          Overall coordination, decision-making, escalation     │
├───────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────────────────┤
│  Tech Lead    │  Comms Lead      │  Scribe                    │
│  Technical    │  Communication   │  Timeline Recording        │
│  Analysis     │                  │                           │

│  Experts      │                  │                           │
│  (SME calls)  │                  │                           │
└───────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

#### Role Distribution for Small Teams

```
Team size-based role distribution:

  2-3 person team:
    • IC + Comms = One person (On-call engineer)
    • TL + Scribe = One person (Support engineer)

  4-6 person team:
    • IC = Senior engineer or EM
    • TL = On-call engineer
    • Comms = EM or PM
    • Scribe = Junior engineer (great learning opportunity!)

  7+ person team:
    • All roles assigned separately
    • SMEs called as needed
```

---

### 4. On-call Operations

On-call is the **24/7 shield protecting the service**. However, poorly managed, it can burn out the team.

#### On-call Rotation Design

```yaml
# on-call-rotation.yaml
rotation:
  name: "Backend Primary On-call"
  type: "weekly"            # weekly, daily, follow-the-sun
  handoff_time: "10:00 KST" # Hand off at business start time
  handoff_day: "Monday"

  participants:
    - name: "Kim Engineer"
      contact:
        phone: "+82-10-xxxx-xxxx"
        slack: "@kim-eng"
    - name: "Lee Engineer"
      contact:
        phone: "+82-10-xxxx-xxxx"
        slack: "@lee-eng"
    - name: "Park Engineer"
      contact:
        phone: "+82-10-xxxx-xxxx"
        slack: "@park-eng"

  # Minimum 3 people required for rotation
  # No person should do on-call for 2+ consecutive weeks

  layers:
    primary:
      escalation_timeout: 5m    # Escalate to Secondary if no response
    secondary:
      escalation_timeout: 10m   # Escalate to Manager if no response
    manager:
      escalation_timeout: 15m   # Escalate to VP if no response
```

#### On-call Best Practices

```
✅ For On-call to Work Well:

  📋 Runbooks Prepared
    • All alerts must have documented response procedures
    • "What do I do when I get this alert?" → Answer should be in Runbook
    • Alert → Runbook link auto-connection

  👥 Appropriate Rotation
    • Minimum 3 people (ideally 5-6)
    • 1 week on-call → minimum 2 weeks off
    • Follow-the-Sun: Distribute by timezone for global teams

  💰 Compensation System
    • On-call stipend (on-call + page-out bonus)
    • Additional pay for night/weekend pages
    • Compensatory time off
    • "No compensation for on-call = Burnout scheduled"

  📱 Handoff
    • During shift change, communicate current issues and cautions
    • Delay handoff if incident is in progress
    • Use handoff checklist

  🧘 Prevent Burnout
    • Target of 2 or fewer alerts per week
    • Aggressively eliminate unnecessary alerts
    • If on-call gets paged at night, allow late arrival next day
    • Regular alert quality reviews
```

#### On-call Handoff Template

```markdown
## On-call Handoff — 2024-W03 (Kim Engineer → Lee Engineer)

### Major Incidents from Last Week
- [INC-0042] Tuesday payment API delay → Resolved (DB index added)
- [INC-0043] Friday CDN cache error → Under monitoring

### Current Items to Watch
- [ ] Wednesday DB migration planned — Alerts may increase
- [ ] New payment module canary deployment — Monitor error rate
- [ ] Redis memory 80% — Near threshold

### Known Flaky Alerts
- `disk-usage-high` on node-07: Temp volume issue, can ignore
- `pod-restart` on cronjob-cleanup: Normal operation, fix planned

### Escalation Contacts
- DB issues: @Park DBA (010-xxxx-xxxx)
- Infrastructure issues: @Choi Infrastructure (010-xxxx-xxxx)
- Payment issues: @Jung Payment Lead (010-xxxx-xxxx)
```

### 5. Escalation Policies

Escalation is **a signal that higher-level response is needed**. Don't hesitate to escalate.

    style Alert fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style P4 fill:#8e44ad,color:#fff
    style EscTech fill:#e67e22,color:#fff
```

#### Two Types of Escalation

```
📈 Functional Escalation
   = "This isn't my area of expertise"
   → Hand off to subject matter expert (SME)
   Example: Backend on-call finds network issue → Call network engineer

📊 Hierarchical Escalation
   = "This needs higher-level decision authority"
   → Report to manager/executive
   Example: Complete service down → Notify CTO, get approval for public notification
```

#### Escalation Decision Criteria

```
When Should You Escalate?

  Immediate escalation:
    ⬆️ SEV1 incidents — mandatory
    ⬆️ Possible data loss
    ⬆️ Security breach (see also: Security Incident Response)
    ⬆️ Legal/compliance impact

  After 15 minutes:
    ⬆️ Can't identify root cause
    ⬆️ Don't know how to mitigate
    ⬆️ Impact scope is expanding

  After 30 minutes:
    ⬆️ Mitigation not working
    ⬆️ Need additional resources
    ⬆️ SEV2 showing signs of becoming SEV1

  ⚠️ "Escalation isn't failure. Late escalation is failure."
```

### 6. Communication

During an outage, communication is as important as technical response. **Silence breeds anxiety.**

#### Communication Channels by Purpose

```
Channel-specific purposes:

  🔴 Incident Slack Channel (#inc-20240115-payment-failure)
     • Technical response communication only
     • No bystanders — participants only
     • Record critical decisions

  🟡 Status Page (status.company.com)

### 7. Blameless Post-mortems

A post-mortem is **not "who did wrong" but "why did the system allow this"**.

#### What is Blameless Culture?

```
❌ Blame Culture:
   "Kim dev deployed wrong config to production."
   → Result: People hide mistakes and don't report problems

✅ Blameless Culture:
   "There was no validation process for production config changes,
    so wrong config could be deployed without review."
   → Result: Focus on system improvement and honest sharing

Core Principles:
  • People make mistakes. Systems should prevent them.
  • Ask "why/how", not "who".
  • If the second person could make the same mistake, it's a system problem.
  • The person who made the mistake learned the most. Punishment destroys learning.
```

#### Post-mortem Template

```markdown
# Post-mortem: [INC-2024-0115-001] Payment API Failure

## Basic Info
| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| Incident ID | INC-2024-0115-001 |
| Severity | SEV2 |
| Incident Commander | Kim IC |
| Author | Lee TL |
| Written | 2024-01-17 |
| Review Date | 2024-01-22 |

## Summary
On January 15, 2024, from 14:25 to 15:30 (approximately 65 minutes),
the payment API experienced response delays. The root cause was database connection
pool exhaustion, and approximately 30% of payment requests experienced timeout errors.

## Impact
- **Duration**: 65 minutes (14:25 ~ 15:30 KST)
- **Affected Users**: ~12,000
- **Failed Payment Transactions**: ~850
- **Revenue Impact**: ~₩15,000,000 (mostly recovered via client retries)
- **SLA Impact**: Monthly availability 99.95% → 99.91%

## Timeline
| Time (KST) | Event |
|------------|--------|
| 14:20 | DB connection pool usage increasing |
| 14:25 | Payment API p99 latency > 10 sec alert fired |
| 14:28 | On-call @Lee TL acknowledged PagerDuty alert |
| 14:30 | Incident declared, #inc-20240115-payment Slack channel created |
| 14:35 | DB connection pool 100% exhausted confirmed |
| 14:38 | Root cause identified: New batch job consuming excess connections |
| 14:40 | Mitigation: Batch job stopped |
| 14:45 | Connection pool recovery started |
| 14:50 | Payment API response time normalized |
| 15:00 | Batch job restarted with connection limits |
| 15:30 | Stability confirmed, incident closed |

## Root Cause
The new batch job (daily settlement report) was acquiring connections from the
DB connection pool without limit, exhausting the entire connection pool.

**Contributing Factors**:
1. No separate connection pool for batch jobs vs. service workload
2. No load testing performed when deploying batch job
3. Connection pool usage alert threshold was too high (90%)

## What Went Well
- Alert fired accurately within 5 minutes
- On-call engineer acknowledged within 3 minutes
- Root cause identified relatively quickly (8 minutes)
- Status page updates were timely

## What Didn't Go Well
- No separation between batch and service connection pools
- No resource limit policy for batch jobs
- Connection pool alert threshold too high (90%)

## Lucky Breaks
- Not during peak hours (2 PM). If it had been 8 PM, impact would be 5x worse
- Most failed payments recovered via automatic client retries

## Action Items
| # | Action | Priority | Owner | Due | Status |
|---|--------|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Separate batch/service connection pools | P1 | @Lee TL | 01/22 | In Progress |
| 2 | Set connection limits for batch jobs | P1 | @Kim BE | 01/19 | Complete |
| 3 | Lower connection pool alert threshold to 70% | P2 | @Park SRE | 01/22 | In Progress |
| 4 | Establish load test process for batch deployments | P2 | @Lee TL | 01/29 | Not Started |
| 5 | Add connection pool auto-recovery logic | P3 | @Kim BE | 02/05 | Not Started |
```

#### Post-mortem Process

```
Post-mortem Steps:

  1️⃣ Draft (within 48 hours of incident end)
     • IC or TL creates using the template above
     • Timeline should be as detailed as possible

  2️⃣ Review Request
     • Share with all incident participants
     • Add missing or incorrect details

  3️⃣ Post-mortem Review Meeting (30-60 minutes)
     • Attendees: IC, TL, involved engineers, EM
     • Review timeline
     • Agree on root cause
     • Prioritize action items
     • ⚠️ No blame, focus on system improvement

  4️⃣ Register Action Items
     • Create tickets in Jira/Linear
     • Must specify owner + deadline
     • Include in sprint planning

  5️⃣ Track and Complete
     • Check progress in weekly meetings
     • Escalate incomplete P1 items
     • Close post-mortem when all items complete

  Medium team (15-50): PagerDuty (on-call) + Incident.io (management)
  Large team (50+):   PagerDuty + Incident.io + FireHydrant (status page)
  Customer-facing:    FireHydrant (status page integration is key)

Selection Guide:
  • On-call/escalation is top priority → PagerDuty
  • Already in Atlassian ecosystem → OpsGenie
  • Want everything in Slack → Incident.io
  • Workflow automation is key → Rootly
  • External status page + incident integration → FireHydrant

## 💻 Try It Yourself

### Practice 1: Incident Response Simulation (Tabletop Exercise)

The best way to practice incident response without actual outages.

```markdown
## 🎮 Tabletop Exercise: "Payment System Failure Scenario"

### Requirements
- Participants: 3-6 people (assign IC, TL, Comms, Scribe roles)
- Slack channel: #tabletop-exercise-001
- Time: 30-45 minutes

### Scenario Cards (Presented sequentially by facilitator)

---

📋 [T+0] Scenario Start
"You receive a PagerDuty alert:
 'Payment API - Error rate > 5%'
 Current time: Tuesday 2 PM"

Questions:
  - What's your first action?
  - What tools do you check?

---

📋 [T+5] Status Update
"Payment API error rate is now 15%.
 Error logs show: 'Connection timeout to payment-gateway.external.com'
 External payment gateway seems unresponsive."

Questions:
  - What severity level? Why?
  - What mitigation steps?
  - Who do you notify?

---

📋 [T+10] Situation Worsens
"Error rate reaches 40%.
 Flood of '... payment failed' from CS team.
 Payment gateway status page says 'Operating normally'."

Questions:
  - Escalate SEV level?
  - Contact external gateway?
  - What's the status page message?
  - Customer messaging?

---

📋 [T+20] New Information
"Network team reports: Firewall rules changed this morning.
 Payment gateway traffic is intermittently blocked."

Questions:
  - Root cause found?
  - Mitigation steps?
  - Who changed the firewall? (Blameless!)

---

📋 [T+30] Resolution
"Firewall rules restored. Payment error rate returns to 0%.
 Stability confirmed after 15 min monitoring."

Questions:
  - Close incident?
  - Follow-up actions?
  - Post-mortem action items?
```

### Practice 2: Writing a Post-mortem

Write a post-mortem based on the scenario above. Use the template provided earlier.

```markdown
## Exercise

Based on the Tabletop Exercise scenario:

1. Fill in each section of the post-mortem template
2. Focus especially on:
   - Accurate timeline recording
   - Distinguish root cause from contributing factors
   - Balance "what went well" vs. "what didn't"
   - Specific action items (owner + deadline + measurable)
3. Verify blameless (non-blaming) language

❌ "Network team's Choi dev changed firewall rules incorrectly"
✅ "The firewall rule change process lacked impact validation for payment services"
```

### Practice 3: Write an On-call Runbook

Create a Runbook for frequently occurring alerts.

```markdown
# Runbook: Payment API — High Error Rate

## Alert Condition
- `payment_api_error_rate > 5%` for 5 minutes

## Severity Determination
| Error Rate | Severity | Response |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| 5-10%     | SEV3     | Start investigation, during business hours |
| 10-30%    | SEV2     | Declare incident, immediate response |
| 30%+      | SEV1     | Declare incident, executive notification |

## Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Confirm Impact
```bash
# Check Grafana dashboard
# URL: https://grafana.company.com/d/payment-overview

# Or check directly
curl -s https://api.company.com/payment/health | jq .
```

### Step 2: Identify Error Type
```bash
# Get recent errors
kubectl logs -l app=payment-api --since=10m | grep ERROR | head -20

# Categorize by error type
kubectl logs -l app=payment-api --since=10m | grep ERROR | \
  awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Step 3: Root Cause-Specific Actions

#### Case A: External Gateway Down
- Symptoms: `ConnectionTimeout`, `ServiceUnavailable`
- Actions:
  1. Check external gateway status page
  2. Switch to backup gateway
  ```bash
  kubectl set env deployment/payment-api GATEWAY=secondary
  ```
  3. Contact external gateway support

#### Case B: Database Connection Issue
- Symptoms: `DatabaseConnectionError`, `ConnectionPoolExhausted`
- Actions:
  1. Check DB connection pool status
  2. Identify problematic queries/batch jobs and stop
  3. Increase connection pool if needed

#### Case C: Recent Deployment
- Symptoms: Error spike right after deployment
- Actions:
  1. Check deployment history
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment/payment-api
  ```
  2. Immediate rollback
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/payment-api
  ```
```
